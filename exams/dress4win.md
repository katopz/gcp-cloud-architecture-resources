# [Dress4Win Case Study](https://cloud.google.com/certification/guides/cloud-architect/casestudy-dress4win-rev2)

## Business Requirements

 - Build a reliable and reproducible environment with scaled parity of production.
- Improve security by defining and adhering to a set of security and Identity and Access Management (IAM) best practices for cloud.
- Improve business agility and speed of innovation through rapid provisioning of new resources.
- Analyze and optimize architecture for performance in the cloud.

## Technical Requirements
- Easily create non-production environments in the cloud.
- Implement an automation framework for provisioning resources in cloud.
- Implement a continuous deployment process for deploying applications to the on-premises datacenter or cloud.
- Support failover of the production environment to cloud during an emergency.
- Encrypt data on the wire and at rest.
- Support multiple private connections between the production data center and cloud environment.

## Executive Statement
Our investors are concerned about our ability to scale and contain costs with our current infrastructure. They are also concerned that a competitor could use a public cloud platform to offset their up-front investment and free them to focus on developing better features. Our traffic patterns are highest in the mornings and weekend evenings; during other times, 80% of our capacity is sitting idle.

Our capital expenditure is now exceeding our quarterly projections. Migrating to the cloud will likely cause an initial increase in spending, but we expect to fully transition before our next hardware refresh cycle. Our total cost of ownership (TCO) analysis over the next 5 years for a public cloud strategy achieves a cost reduction between 30% and 50% over our current model.

## Question 6
#### For this question, refer to the Dress4Win case study.

## Question 7
#### For this question, refer to the Dress4Win case study.
As part of their new application experience, Dress4Wm allows customers to upload images of themselves. The customer has exclusive control over who may view these images. Customers should be able to upload images with minimal latency and also be shown their images quickly on the main application page when they log in. Which configuration should Dress4Win use?

## Question 11
#### For this question, refer to the Dress4Win case study.
The current Dress4win system architecture has high latency to some customers because it is located in one data center.
As of a future evaluation and optimizing for performance in the cloud, Dresss4win wants to distribute it's system architecture to multiple locations when Google cloud platform. Which approach should they use?

- [ ] A. Use regional managed instance groups and a global load balancer to increase performance because the regional managed instance group can grow instances in each region separately based on traffic.
- [ ] B. Use a global load balancer with a set of virtual machines that forward the requests to a closer group of virtual machines managed by your operations team.
- [ ] C. Use regional managed instance groups and a global load balancer to increase reliability by providing automatic failover between zones in different regions.
